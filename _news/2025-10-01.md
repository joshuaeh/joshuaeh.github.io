I'm looking forward to attending this year's annual AIChE meeting in Boston. I will be presenting work on NN model updating on Wednesday in session 10E Advances in Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems II as well as in the "Meet the Faculty/Post-Doc Candidates" and "Meet the Industry Candidates" poster sessions
