I am interested in elegant, seemingly-simple solutions to challenging interdisciplinary problems.

I am currently completing a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at AustinðŸ¤˜.

My interests include optimization under uncertainty, data-driven modeling and optimization (and the challenges that occur in practice), and fundamental systems engineering challenges.
